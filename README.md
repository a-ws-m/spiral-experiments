Spiral Experiments
==================

What started off as an idea to do with Bezier curves ended up with me playing
around with polar coordinates and rotation, as well as the `curveVertex`
function in `p5.js`.

Instructions
------------

Observe. The rotation goes slower as you hover the mouse closer to the centre.
Hovering over the left side of the screen causes it to rotate in the opposite
direction from the right. Left click to cycle through some colours, press Enter
to save a screenshot.
